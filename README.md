### Main file

Main file is `find-perfect-matchings.py`, which finds perfect matchings for a snark.

Should work with any graph that can be read by networkx, would have to change read function based on format.

### Other file

The other file is `match.sage`, which requires sage to use. This file is unfinished and still has some bugs. However, its main attept is to find the associated polyhedral volume of a graph using its perfect matchings.
